A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
A double blessing is a double grace,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
A piece of him.
A sable silver'd.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
ACT I
Against the which, a moiety competent
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
All
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And carriage of the article design'd,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And I am sick at heart.
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
And it must follow, as the night the day,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And let us once again assail your ears,
And liegemen to the Dane.
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And recks not his own rede.
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
And then it started like a guilty thing
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
And these few precepts in thy memory
And they in France of the best rank and station
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
And vanish'd from our sight.
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
And we did think it writ down in our duty
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And will not let belief take hold of him
And with no less nobility of love
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Arm'd, my lord.
Arm'd, say you?
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
As he in his particular act and place
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
As if increase of appetite had grown
As it doth well appear unto our state--
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
As of a father: for let the world take note,
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
As thou art to thyself:
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Ay, madam, it is common.
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Before my God, I might not this believe

Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
But answer made it none: yet once methought
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
But I have that within which passeth show;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
But let me hear from you.
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
But to recover of us, by strong hand
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
But where was this?
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
By laboursome petition, and at last
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
Cock crows
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Contagious blastments are most imminent.

Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
Did you not speak to it?
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
Do you doubt that?
Do, if it will not stand.
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat

Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
Farewell.
Farewell.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
For food and diet, to some enterprise
For God's love, let me hear.
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
For he himself is subject to his birth:
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
For they are actions that a man might play:
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
For what we know must be and is as common
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,

Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;

Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
Have you had quiet guard?
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
He was a man, take him for all in all,
He.
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
His beard was grizzled--no?
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
Hold you the watch to-night?
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,

Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
I am glad to see you well:
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
I have seen nothing.
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
I shall not look upon his like again.
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
I think it be no other but e'en so:
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
I warrant it will.
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
I will watch to-night;
I would I had been there.
I would not hear your enemy say so,
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
I'll visit you.
If it assume my noble father's person,
If it be,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
If there be any good thing to be done,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Importing the surrender of those lands
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
In filial obligation for some term
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
In obstinate condolement is a course
In that and all things will we show our duty.
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
In what particular thought to work I know not;
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Is it not like the king?
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Is the main motive of our preparations,
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
It is most retrograde to our desire:
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
It is offended.
It lifted up its head and did address
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
It would be spoke to.
It would have much amazed you.
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;

Last night of all,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
Long live the king!
Longer, longer.
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.

May give his saying deed; which is no further
Most constantly.
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
My dread lord,
My father!--methinks I see my father.
My father's brother, but no more like my father
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
My good lord--
My lord, from head to foot.
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
My lord, I did;
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
My lord, the king your father.
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Nay, very pale.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
No more but so?
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
Not a mouse stirring.
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
Not when I saw't.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
O, farewell, honest soldier:
O, fear me not.
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Of mine own eyes.
Of these delated articles allow.
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,

Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Our duty to your honour.
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
Pale or red?
Passing through nature to eternity.
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
Perchance 'twill walk again.
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!

Saw? who?
Say,
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
Season your admiration for awhile
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
See, it stalks away!
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
Sit down awhile;
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Such was the very armour he had on
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
That are so fortified against our story
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
That can I;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
That if again this apparition come,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
That was and is the question of these wars.
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
The bell then beating one,--
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
The head is not more native to the heart,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
The inward service of the mind and soul
The king my father!
The lists and full proportions, are all made
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
The safety and health of this whole state;
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
The source of this our watch and the chief head
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
Then saw you not his face?
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
Therefore I have entreated him along
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
These hands are not more like.
Think it no more;
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
This marvel to you.
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This present object made probation.
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
'Tis gone!
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
'Tis strange.
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
'Tis very strange.
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To business with the king, more than the scope
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
To give these mourning duties to your father:
To his confine: and of the truth herein
To his unmaster'd importunity.
To let you know of it.
To make it truster of your own report
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
To offer it the show of violence;
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
To show my duty in your coronation,
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Together with that fair and warlike form
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
We do, my lord.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Well, good night.
Well, sit we down,
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
What I have said to you.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
What think you on't?
What we have two nights seen.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
What, is Horatio there?
What, look'd he frowningly?
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Where, my lord?
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Who hath relieved you?
Who is't that can inform me?
Who's there?
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Without the sensible and true avouch
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
You are the most immediate to our throne;
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
You come most carefully upon your hour.
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
Your leave and favour to return to France;
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.

Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
Do, if it will not stand.
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
Friends to this ground.
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Have you had quiet guard?
My dread lord,
My good lord--
Arm'd, my lord.
Where, my lord?
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
We do, my lord.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
If it be,
Then saw you not his face?
As he in his particular act and place
Bernardo has my place.
A double blessing is a double grace,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
Your leave and favour to return to France;
To offer it the show of violence;
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
The lists and full proportions, are all made
And recks not his own rede.
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
QUEEN GERTRUDE
QUEEN GERTRUDE
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
'Tis strange.
'Tis very strange.
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
He.
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
These hands are not more like.
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Nay, very pale.
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
Sit down awhile;
Season your admiration for awhile
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
Who is't that can inform me?
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
That if again this apparition come,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
And liegemen to the Dane.
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
The bell then beating one,--
If there be any good thing to be done,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
'Tis gone!
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
You are the most immediate to our throne;
From top to toe?
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
I would I had been there.
What, is Horatio there?
Who's there?
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
It is most retrograde to our desire:
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
Think it no more;
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
In obstinate condolement is a course
SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
The safety and health of this whole state;
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
As it doth well appear unto our state--
As of a father: for let the world take note,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
Before my God, I might not this believe
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
And with no less nobility of love
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
As thou art to thyself:
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
And then it started like a guilty thing
I have seen nothing.
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Is it not like the king?
Long live the king!
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Not a mouse stirring.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Therefore I have entreated him along
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
Appears before them, and with solemn march
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Without the sensible and true avouch
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
For he himself is subject to his birth:
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
That can I;
ACT I
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
All
Last night of all,
He was a man, take him for all in all,
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
I am glad to see you well:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Farewell.
Farewell.
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
I warrant it will.
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
The inward service of the mind and soul
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
And will not let belief take hold of him
A piece of him.
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
In filial obligation for some term
Together with that fair and warlike form
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
What we have two nights seen.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
I shall not look upon his like again.
Perchance 'twill walk again.
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
To his confine: and of the truth herein
Such was the very armour he had on
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
This present object made probation.
To show my duty in your coronation,
And they in France of the best rank and station
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
For what we know must be and is as common
Ay, madam, it is common.
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
If it assume my noble father's person,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
Well, sit we down,
As if increase of appetite had grown
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

His beard was grizzled--no?
I think it be no other but e'en so:
No more but so?
I would not hear your enemy say so,
It would be spoke to.
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
Hail to your lordship!
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
For God's love, let me hear.
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Longer, longer.
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
My lord, the king your father.
To give these mourning duties to your father:
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
My father!--methinks I see my father.
My father's brother, but no more like my father
The king my father!
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
May give his saying deed; which is no further
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Giving to you no further personal power
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
You come most carefully upon your hour.
Our duty to your honour.
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
Importing the surrender of those lands
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
As harbingers preceding still the fates
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?

Together with remembrance of ourselves.
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Of mine own eyes.
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But where was this?
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
Is the main motive of our preparations,
And let us once again assail your ears,
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
That was and is the question of these wars.
It lifted up its head and did address
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:

Nor any unproportioned thought his act.

Well, good night.
Give you good night.
Give you good night.
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
Hold you the watch to-night?
I will watch to-night;
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
And vanish'd from our sight.
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
But answer made it none: yet once methought
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
To let you know of it.
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
Did you not speak to it?
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Exit
Exit
Exit
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
Exeunt
O, fear me not.
In what particular thought to work I know not;
My lord, from head to foot.
The head is not more native to the heart,
And I am sick at heart.
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
To make it truster of your own report
By laboursome petition, and at last
Enter Ghost
Re-enter Ghost
Exit Ghost
Exit Ghost
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Who hath relieved you?
It would have much amazed you.
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
But let me hear from you.
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
What I have said to you.
This marvel to you.
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
I'll visit you.
Arm'd, say you?
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
But I have that within which passeth show;
Of these delated articles allow.
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
And it must follow, as the night the day,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
For they are actions that a man might play:
Say,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
See, it stalks away!
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
What, look'd he frowningly?
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Most constantly.
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And these few precepts in thy memory
That are so fortified against our story
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Passing through nature to eternity.
To his unmaster'd importunity.
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
And we did think it writ down in our duty
In that and all things will we show our duty.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,

SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

BERNARDO
Who's there?
FRANCISCO
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
BERNARDO
Long live the king!
FRANCISCO
Bernardo?
BERNARDO
He.
FRANCISCO
You come most carefully upon your hour.
BERNARDO
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
FRANCISCO
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
BERNARDO
Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO
Not a mouse stirring.
BERNARDO
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRANCISCO
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO
Friends to this ground.
MARCELLUS
And liegemen to the Dane.
FRANCISCO
Give you good night.
MARCELLUS
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?

Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.
Exit

Holla! Bernardo!
BERNARDO
Say,
What, is Horatio there?
HORATIO
A piece of him.
BERNARDO
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
BERNARDO
I have seen nothing.
MARCELLUS
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
HORATIO
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
BERNARDO
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.
HORATIO
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
BERNARDO
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--
Enter Ghost

MARCELLUS
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
BERNARDO
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
MARCELLUS
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
BERNARDO
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
HORATIO
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
BERNARDO
It would be spoke to.
MARCELLUS
Question it, Horatio.
HORATIO
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
MARCELLUS
It is offended.
BERNARDO
See, it stalks away!
HORATIO
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
BERNARDO
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
HORATIO
Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
MARCELLUS
Is it not like the king?
HORATIO
As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
MARCELLUS
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
HORATIO
In what particular thought to work I know not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
MARCELLUS
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?
HORATIO
That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
BERNARDO
I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.
HORATIO
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Re-enter Ghost

I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
Cock crows

If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
HORATIO
Do, if it will not stand.
BERNARDO
'Tis here!
HORATIO
'Tis here!
MARCELLUS
'Tis gone!
Exit Ghost

We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
BERNARDO
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
HORATIO
And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.
MARCELLUS
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
HORATIO
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
MARCELLUS
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants
KING CLAUDIUS
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
In that and all things will we show our duty.
KING CLAUDIUS
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
LAERTES
My dread lord,
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
KING CLAUDIUS
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
LORD POLONIUS
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
KING CLAUDIUS
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
HAMLET
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
KING CLAUDIUS
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
HAMLET
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.
HAMLET
Ay, madam, it is common.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?
HAMLET
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play:
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
KING CLAUDIUS
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father:
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
HAMLET
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
KING CLAUDIUS
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
Exeunt all but HAMLET

HAMLET
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
My father's brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO

HORATIO
Hail to your lordship!
HAMLET
I am glad to see you well:
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
HORATIO
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
HAMLET
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
MARCELLUS
My good lord--
HAMLET
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
HORATIO
A truant disposition, good my lord.
HAMLET
I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
HORATIO
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
HAMLET
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
HORATIO
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
HAMLET
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My father!--methinks I see my father.
HORATIO
Where, my lord?
HAMLET
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
HORATIO
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
HAMLET
He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.
HORATIO
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
HAMLET
Saw? who?
HORATIO
My lord, the king your father.
HAMLET
The king my father!
HORATIO
Season your admiration for awhile
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.
HAMLET
For God's love, let me hear.
HORATIO
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.
HAMLET
But where was this?
MARCELLUS
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
HAMLET
Did you not speak to it?
HORATIO
My lord, I did;
But answer made it none: yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish'd from our sight.
HAMLET
'Tis very strange.
HORATIO
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.
HAMLET
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
We do, my lord.
HAMLET
Arm'd, say you?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
Arm'd, my lord.
HAMLET
From top to toe?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
My lord, from head to foot.
HAMLET
Then saw you not his face?
HORATIO
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
HAMLET
What, look'd he frowningly?
HORATIO
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
HAMLET
Pale or red?
HORATIO
Nay, very pale.
HAMLET
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
HORATIO
Most constantly.
HAMLET
I would I had been there.
HORATIO
It would have much amazed you.
HAMLET
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
HORATIO
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
Longer, longer.
HORATIO
Not when I saw't.
HAMLET
His beard was grizzled--no?
HORATIO
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.
HAMLET
I will watch to-night;
Perchance 'twill walk again.
HORATIO
I warrant it will.
HAMLET
If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
I'll visit you.
All
Our duty to your honour.
HAMLET
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
Exeunt all but HAMLET

My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit

SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
LAERTES
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.
OPHELIA
Do you doubt that?
LAERTES
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
OPHELIA
No more but so?
LAERTES
Think it no more;
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth:
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmaster'd importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
OPHELIA
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede.
LAERTES
O, fear me not.
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Enter POLONIUS

A double blessing is a double grace,
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
LORD POLONIUS
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
LAERTES
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
LAERTES
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
What I have said to you.
OPHELIA
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
LAERTES
Farewell.
ExitOPHELIA
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
LAERTES
Farewell.
