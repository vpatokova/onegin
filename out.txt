Long live the king!

Holla! Bernardo!
Friends to this ground.

BERNARDO
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
FRANCISCO
Bernardo?
BERNARDO
He.
FRANCISCO
You come most carefully upon your hour.
BERNARDO
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
A piece of him.
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
Who's there?
Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO
HORATIO
Well, good night.
BERNARDO
Not a mouse stirring.
BERNARDO
Say,
FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO

FRANCISCO
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
And liegemen to the Dane.

Give you good night.

O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
ACT I
MARCELLUS
Exit
FRANCISCO
FRANCISCO
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
